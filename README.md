   <h3>Instruction for Use</h3>
      <p>
        The audio visualizer was built for Mac OS. The following keys can be used to modyfy the program: <br>
        <br>
        K / L - switch between two kinds of spectrum history representations: <br>
        default (L): spectrum history displayed as setteling particles that float into the ether <br>
        key K: spectrum history displayed in circles that the history travels through over time <br>
        <br>
        N - switch audio input from microphone to ChucK audio file: <br>
        default: audio input is microphone
        key N: Chuck audio file is played <br>
        <br>
        C - switch between camera on rails to moving the camera freely to explore the scene: <br>
        default: camera starts zooming into the planetary exploration and leads user along a fixed path <br>
        key C: camera can be moved freely in the scene by using the A, W, S, D keys for 
        zoom in, zoom out, right, left movement of the camera
